# Issue Detail Page Fix

## Problem
The issue detail page at `https://navigator-wine.vercel.app/issue/devsel%2Fl3-react-bebrave-app/82?from=/` was not opening properly.

## Root Cause
The main issue was **authentication**. When users visit a direct link to an issue detail page, they need to be authenticated with GitLab credentials first. The app was showing an "Authentication Required" message instead of the issue details.

## URL Structure Analysis
- **Route Pattern**: `/issue/:projectId/:issueIid`
- **Example URL**: `/issue/devsel%2Fl3-react-bebrave-app/82?from=/`
- **Decoded Project Path**: `devsel/l3-react-bebrave-app`
- **Issue IID**: `82`
- **Query Parameter**: `from=/` (for navigation back)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Messages
- Improved the authentication required message to show which issue the user is trying to access
- Added better error details in the "Issue Not Found" screen
- Shows the decoded project path and issue IID for debugging

### 2. Redirect After Login Flow
- When users click "Go to Login" from an issue detail page, the current URL is stored in localStorage
- After successful authentication, users are automatically redirected back to the original issue URL
- This provides a seamless user experience for direct links

### 3. Debug Component
- Created `DebugIssueUrl.tsx` component to help troubleshoot URL parsing issues
- Available at `/debug/issue/:projectId/:issueIid` route
- Shows raw and processed URL parameters, query params, and expected API calls

## Code Changes

### IssueDetailPage.tsx
- Enhanced authentication required message with issue details
- Added localStorage-based redirect functionality
- Improved error handling with more specific information

### Index.tsx
- Modified `handleCredentialsSubmit` to check for stored redirect URLs
- Automatically redirects users back to their intended destination after login

### App.tsx
- Added debug route for troubleshooting URL issues

## How It Works Now

1. **Direct Link Access**: User visits issue URL directly
2. **Authentication Check**: App checks for stored GitLab credentials
3. **Redirect to Login**: If not authenticated, shows login prompt and stores current URL
4. **Login Process**: User enters GitLab credentials
5. **Automatic Redirect**: After successful login, user is redirected back to the original issue
6. **Issue Display**: Issue details are loaded and displayed

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Clear localStorage to simulate unauthenticated state
2. Visit a direct issue URL like `/issue/devsel%2Fl3-react-bebrave-app/82`
3. Verify authentication prompt appears with issue details
4. Login with GitLab credentials
5. Verify automatic redirect back to the issue page
6. Confirm issue details load properly

## Debug URL

For troubleshooting, use the debug URL:
`/debug/issue/devsel%2Fl3-react-bebrave-app/82`

This will show all URL parsing details without requiring authentication.
